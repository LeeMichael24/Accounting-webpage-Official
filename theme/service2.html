                employees and the government.
                Why deal with the nuances of payroll in-house when you can have a payroll specialist do it for you as
                part of our BOSS™ outsourced accounting solution.

                    Employer Identification Number or EIN from the IRS.
                    This is basically the Social Security Number of your business, and is necessary when reporting
                    information to the IRS and state governments.

                    is to define pay periods.
                    You may have a pay period in mind, but must consider that pay periods are usually dictated by the
                    state, which guide the amount of time between expected paychecks.

                    appeals to the talent you are seeking to attract.
                    Is the work best suited for an employee or contractor? Will the positions be salary or hourly? Full
                    time or part time? Will you offer paid vacation? Overtime?
                    How will you track hours worked? What about healthcare benefits and retirement plans which will need
                    to be deducted from checks and paid to the corresponding providers?
                    What about worker's compensation insurance? All of these questions need to be answered and
                    documented for your business beforehand.

                    contractors that you won’t be withholding income tax from their pay —
                    contractors must pay their own taxes on this income. If your business pays people or other small
