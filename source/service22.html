                    vary

                are several
                ways to ensure you are not overpaying on your taxes, and with the

                There are two ways to determine whether or not you are a resident. A green card accords you the
                privilege of permanent residency in the United States as an immigrant. Those who do not possess a green
                card can qualify for residency if they can prove a physical presence in the country for the requisite
                time period through the <a class="text-primary"

                <strong>As a resident non-US citizen you follow the same rules and procedures as a US citizen; however
                    you will
                    pay taxes on your worldwide income rather than just US income</strong>. The terms of your visa may
                also require
                you to file income taxes, and in the future it may be necessary to show proof to change the status of
                the visa, obtain permanent residency, or re-enter the US once you have left. Failure to comply with US
                tax laws could easily have a dramatic impact on your future.

                The US government may consider you a resident responsible for paying taxes from the first day you are
                present in the US as a permanent resident. For those who were nonresidents who obtained resident status
                during the first year of residency, you may be classified as a dual-status alien for tax purposes. As
                such, you may have to file under a separate return and cannot claim the standard deduction or dependency
                exemptions.
